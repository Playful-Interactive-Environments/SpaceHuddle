## Routes

All the routes are defined in [config/routes.php](https://github.com/odan/slim4-skeleton/blob/master/config/routes.php).

Each route will be defined by a method that corresponds to the HTTP verb. 

For example, a `GET` request is defined as follows:

```php
$app->get('/users', \App\Action\User\UserFindAction::class);
```
