# Validation

Depending on the use case, different strategies are appropriate for the input validation.

## Form and JSON validation

This project comes with [cakephp/validation](https://github.com/cakephp/validation) +
[selective/validation](https://github.com/selective-php/validation) and contains some usage examples.

The `cakephp/validation` component is need to validate complex form data (arrays) against a specific set of rules, 
and the `selective/validation` component collects the validation errors, throws validation exceptions
and transforms the result into a proper JSON response.
