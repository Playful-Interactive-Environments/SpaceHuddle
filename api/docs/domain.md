# Domain

***Domain** is an entry point to the domain logic forming the core of the 
application. It may be a Transaction Script, Service Layer, 
Application Service, or something similar.*

## Domain vs. Infrastructure

**Domain**

* **Use cases:** Services with the business logic
* **Model:** Value Objects, DTOs, Entities
* **Interfaces for boundary objects:** The repository interfaces

**Infrastructure**

* Framework-specific code
* Implementations for boundary objects, e.g. the repository classes (communication with the database)
* Web controllers (actions), CLI, etc.

## Services

Here is the right place for complex **business logic** e.g. calculation, validation, transaction handling, file creation etc.
Business logic is a step up on complexity over CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations.

An (application) service can be called directly from the action, a service, the CLI and the unit tests.

By separating behavior from data, it's possible to build and maintain non-trivial applications over many years.
This architecture also respects the [SOLID](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) principles to be [TDD](https://hackernoon.com/introduction-to-test-driven-development-tdd-61a13bc92d92) - friendly as much as possible.

## Repositories

A [repository](https://designpatternsphp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/More/Repository/README.html) 
is the source of all the (database) data your application needs and mediates between the domain and data mapping layers. 
A repository improves code maintainability, testing and readability by separating **business logic** 
from **data access logic** and provides centrally managed and consistent access rules for a data source.

There are two types of repositories: collection-oriented and persistence-oriented repositories. 
In this case, we are talking about **persistence-oriented repositories**, since these are better 
suited for processing large amounts of data.
 
Each public repository method represents a query. The return values represent the result set 
of a query and can be primitive/object or list (array) of them. Database transactions must 
be handled on a higher level (service) and not within a repository.

**Quick summary:**

* Communication with the database.
* Place for the data access (query) logic.
* Uses data mapper to create domain objects
* This is no place for the business logic. Use [services](#services) for the business logic.

## Advantages

* By separating domain from infrastructure code you automatically **increase testability**
* You can replace an **adapter** without affecting the **ports**
* You can **postpone** the choice for database vendor, framework, query builder, mailer, etc.
* You can more easily **keep up** with the change rate of the framework-specific code...
* or replace the framework altogether
