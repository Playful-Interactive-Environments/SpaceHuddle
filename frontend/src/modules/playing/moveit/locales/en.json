      "carbonDioxideExplanation": "At only about 0.038 percent, CO2 makes up a small part of the air. However, in its function as a greenhouse gas, it plays a decisive role in our climate: CO2 absorbs part of the heat emitted by the earth into space and radiates it back to the earth. This natural greenhouse effect creates the temperate climate we know on Earth, which allows flora and fauna to thrive.",
      "dustExplanation": "In humans, fine dust can penetrate the nasal cavity, the lungs and even the bloodstream. Depending on the size and penetration depth of the particles, the health effects of particulate matter vary.",
      "methaneExplanation": "Methane is around 80 times more harmful to the climate than CO2. Methane emissions have already contributed 0.5 degrees to global warming according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In the EU, a lot of methane is produced primarily in the supply chain of natural gas, which consists largely of methane.",
      "microplasticExplanation": "Microplastics are very small pieces of plastic that pollutes the environment. Microplastics are not a specific kind of plastic, but rather any type of plastic fragment that is less than five millimeters in length.",
      "veryGood": "Congratulations, you're already a real pro at cleaning up your emissions.",
      "good": "That was already really good. Next time, try to leave yourself even more room for maneuver by clever driving behavior, then you'll manage the last percent as well.",
      "notBad": "That wasn't bad at all, but there's still more to do. Try to leave more space for cleaning up next time by clever driving behavior, then you will surely manage more next time.",
      "improvable": "You can do better. Try to leave yourself even more air next time when cleaning up by clever driving behavior, then you will surely manage more next time."

      "drive": "In addition to vehicle choice, driving behavior also plays a crucial role. The faster you drive, the more fuel you need.\nIn the statistics above the map you can see how many emissions are released. All emissions in the red marked area go directly into the environment. For all below you have the chance to clean them up.",
      "bus": "But the number of passengers also makes a difference. More people travelling in the same vehicle means more people are sharing the same emissions.\nStop at bus stops to let people get in.",
      "cleanUp": "Now try to clean up the emissions you caused by throwing them into the correct garbage can.\nBy nudging the same particles, you can collect and dispose of several at once.\nBut watch out! If there are too many emissions they will evaporate and get into the environment.\nIn addition to greenhouse gases, microplastics are also released through tire wear and particulate matter.",
      "improve": "Try to leave yourself more air next time when cleaning up by clever driving behavior, or influence the electricity mix by appropriate measures in the measures map."
