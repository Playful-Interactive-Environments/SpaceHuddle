In the future, drones will be another option for transporting goods such as small parcels or delivering very urgent medical products. They will not only be used to transport parcels, but could also be used to inspect parts of machines that are difficult to reach using a drone. One of the tasks here is to plan when and where the drone should fly. This involves thinking about the best routes for the drone so that it arrives quickly and safely. Before a drone can fly, the pilot must ensure that it is in good condition. He checks the drone, programs it so that it knows where to fly and makes sure that everything is working properly. Other preparations also need to be made, such as obtaining permission to fly so that the drone can take off at all. Finally, a drone pilot flies the drone and possibly controls it from a computer. They must be able to control it very precisely and always ensure that the drone flies safely. A drone pilot also learns a lot about technology and must adhere to many rules so that no one is disturbed or endangered by the drone."

The driver therefore does not steer the trucks himself, but rather helps the trucks to drive all by themselves. They make sure that everything remains safe, even when the truck is driving itself. The main task in this job is to monitor the truck and ensure that everything is working correctly. In this job, you have to be able to react quickly and be ready to take the wheel if the truck suddenly can't drive itself, for example in the event of a technical problem or if an unexpected situation arises on the road. Another task is to plan where and how the truck should drive. Sometimes the route has to be changed if there is a roadworks site on the planned route, for example. Even though you work independently a lot, you still communicate with the team and with a central office that helps to find the best route and organize everything well. In this job, the driver also has to make sure that the truck is in good condition. Checks and small repairs must be carried out to ensure that the truck is safe. You also have to make sure that the load is safe and that everything is on board that the delivery bills say it should be."
